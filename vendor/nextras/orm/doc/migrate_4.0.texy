BC Breaks
=========

We evaluate here only BC breaks you will probably encounter. This major version consists also of other minor (quite internal) BC breaks, i.e. the probability you don't use these semi-public API is quite high.

- **required PHP 7.1 and new types**
  We have added scalar types to Orm interfaces; Some of you implementations have to be updated;
- **required Nextras Dbal 4.0**
  Nextras Dbal comes with own batch of deprecations & changes. See the [release notes](https://github.com/nextras/dbal/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc1).
- **Removed BaseMapper & Collection**
  These classes were just pure aliases. Use specific implementations (DbalMapper / DbalCollection) directly.
- **StorageReflection renamed to Conventions**
  We have renamed StorageReflection classes to Conventions. New name better covers what these classes do. Also, the property name changes from underscored to pascal-cased is handled by inflector class, not by inheritance anymore.
  /--php
  class BooksMapper extends DbalMapper
  {
        // change inflection from SnakeCaseInflector
        protected function createInflector(): IInflector
        {
            return new CamelCaseInflector();
        }

        // add mapping
        protected function createConventions(): IConventions
        {
            $conventions = parent::createConventions();
            $conventions->setMapping('price->cents', 'price');
            return $conventions;
        }
  }
  \--
- **Collection namespace restructured**
  ArrayCollection and DbalCollection moved to Collection sub-namespace; helper classes moved and renamed;
- **Collection: reworked collection functions**
  Custom functions have been completely reworked and simplified, see [docs | collection-functions] what they can do now and how to write them.

  In short:
  - `IArrayFilterFunction` became `IArrayFunction`;
  - `IQueryBuilderFilterFunction` became `IQueryBuilderFunction` and has to return `DbalExpressionResult`;
  - `IArrayFunction` is removed, your functions have be designed as expressions;
  - `IQueryBuilderFunction` is removed, your functions have be designed as expressions;
- **Collection's iterator throws when calling current() on invalid state**
  The iterator implementation is now more typesafe. That means that calling `current()` method on the collection's iterator throws when the iterator is in invalid state, e.g. method next() was called after the last item. This is quite internal thing and usually you don't use it directly. However, there is a bug in nette/latte when using `$iterator`, accessing `$iterator->nextValue` may throw since nette/latte is missing a check. There is already a [PR fixing this bug](https://github.com/nette/latte/pull/230) but until then you may fix it manually:
  /--php
  // before
  {if $iterator->nextValue !== null}{$iterator->nextValue->...}{/if}

  // with temporal fix
  {if $iterator->getInnerIterator()->valid() && $iterator->nextValue !== null}{$iterator->nextValue->...}{/if}
  \--
- **Entity: renamed property containers to property wrappers**
  This is purely naming change when property containers are called wrappers. Use new `{wrapper YourClass}` modifier.
- **Entity: ImmutableValuePropertyContainer was reworked**
  ImmutableValuePropertyContainer - a helper for property wrapper was reworked and renamed to ImmutableValuePropertyWrapper.
  Change contains renamed APIs, wrapper does not depend on entity, and doesn't handle null for you, i.e. you can have now easily nullable property wrapper.

Deprecations
============

- **required Nextras Dbal 4.0**
  See the [release notes](https://github.com/nextras/dbal/releases/tag/v4.0.0-rc1). You will probably encounter deprecated `leftJoin` and other methods, replace them with `joinLeft` and similar.
- **Collection: removed `this->` prefix for relationship traversals**
  Relationship traversal newly does not require putting `this->` prefix in collection filtering expression.
  /--php
  $booksCollection->findBy(['this->author->name' => 'John']);
  // after
  $booksCollection->findBy(['author->name' => 'John']);
  \--
- **Entity/Relationship: deprecated get() method, use toCollection()**
  Relationship conversion to `ICollection` is newly done by `toCollection()` method.
  /--php
  $author->books->toCollection()->findBy(...);
  \--
